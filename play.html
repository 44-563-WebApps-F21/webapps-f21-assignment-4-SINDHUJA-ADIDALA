        SCENE<BR>
            <br>        
        
        <P class="stage-direction">_The Library in Lord Goring’s house_.  _An Adam room_.  _On the right is
        the door leading into the hall_.  _On the left_, _the door of the
        smoking-room_.  _A pair of folding doors at the back open into the
        drawing-room_.  _The fire is lit_.  _Phipps_, _the butler_, _is arranging
        some newspapers on the writing-table_.  _The distinction of Phipps is his
        impassivity_. _He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler_.  _The
        Sphinx is not so incommunicable_.  _He is a mask with a manner_.  _Of his
        intellectual or emotional life_, _history knows nothing_.  _He represents
        the dominance of form_.
        
        [_Enter_ LORD GORING _in evening dress with a buttonhole_.  _He is
        wearing a silk hat and Inverness cape_.  _White-gloved_, _he carries a
        Louis Seize cane_.  _His are all the delicate fopperies of Fashion_.
        _One sees that he stands in immediate relation to modern life_, _makes it
        indeed_, _and so masters it_.  _He is the first well-dressed philosopher
        in the history of thought_.]</P>
        
        <h4 class="name LORD-GORING">LORD GORING.</h4> <p class="speech"> Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?</p>
        <br>
        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
        presents new buttonhole on salver_.]
        
        LORD GORING.  Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
        of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.
        
        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  I have observed that.
        
        LORD GORING.  [_Taking out old buttonhole_.]  You see, Phipps, Fashion is
        what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.
        
        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.
        
        LORD GORING.  Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.
        
        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.
        
        LORD GORING.  [_Putting in a new buttonhole_.]  And falsehoods the truths
        of other people.
        
        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.
        
        LORD GORING.  Other people are quite dreadful.  The only possible society
        is oneself.
        
        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.
        
        LORD GORING.  To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,
        Phipps.
        
        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.
        
        LORD GORING.  [_Looking at himself in the glass_.]  Don’t think I quite
        like this buttonhole, Phipps.  Makes me look a little too old.  Makes me
        almost in the prime of life, eh, Phipps?
        
        PHIPPS.  I don’t observe any alteration in your lordship’s appearance.
        
        LORD GORING.  You don’t, Phipps?
        
        PHIPPS.  No, my lord.
        
        LORD GORING.  I am not quite sure.  For the future a more trivial
        buttonhole, Phipps, on Thursday evenings.
        
        PHIPPS.  I will speak to the florist, my lord.  She has had a loss in her
        family lately, which perhaps accounts for the lack of triviality your
        lordship complains of in the buttonhole.
        
        LORD GORING.  Extraordinary thing about the lower classes in England—they
        are always losing their relations.
        
        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord!  They are extremely fortunate in that respect.
        
        LORD GORING.  [_Turns round and looks at him_.  PHIPPS _remains
        impassive_.]  Hum!  Any letters, Phipps?
        
        PHIPPS.  Three, my lord.  [_Hands letters on a salver_.]
        
        LORD GORING.  [_Takes letters_.]  Want my cab round in twenty minutes.
        
        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [_Goes towards door_.]
        
        LORD GORING.  [_Holds up letter in pink envelope_.]  Ahem!  Phipps, when
        did this letter arrive?
        
        PHIPPS.  It was brought by hand just after your lordship went to the
        club.
        
        LORD GORING.  That will do.  [_Exit_ PHIPPS.]  Lady Chiltern’s
        handwriting on Lady Chiltern’s pink notepaper.  That is rather curious.
        I thought Robert was to write.  Wonder what Lady Chiltern has got to say
        to me?  [_Sits at bureau and opens letter_, _and reads it_.]  ‘I want
        you.  I trust you.  I am coming to you.  Gertrude.’  [_Puts down the
        letter with a puzzled look_.  _Then takes it up_, _and reads it again
        slowly_.]  ‘I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming to you.’  So she has
        found out everything!  Poor woman!  Poor woman!  [ _Pulls out watch and
        looks at it_.]  But what an hour to call!  Ten o’clock!  I shall have to
        give up going to the Berkshires.  However, it is always nice to be
        expected, and not to arrive.  I am not expected at the Bachelors’, so I
        shall certainly go there.  Well, I will make her stand by her husband.
        That is the only thing for her to do.  That is the only thing for any
        woman to do.  It is the growth of the moral sense in women that makes
        marriage such a hopeless, one-sided institution.  Ten o’clock.  She
        should be here soon.  I must tell Phipps I am not in to any one else.
        [_Goes towards bell_.]
        
        [_Enter_ PHIPPS.]
        
        PHIPPS.  Lord Caversham.
        
        LORD GORING.  Oh, why will parents always appear at the wrong time?  Some
        extraordinary mistake in nature, I suppose.  [_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]
        Delighted to see you, my dear father.  [_Goes to meet him_.]
