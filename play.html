    <h2>  LORD GORING.  Other people are quite dreadful.  The only possible society
        is oneself.
        
        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.
        
        LORD GORING.  To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,
        Phipps.
        
        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.
        
        LORD GORING.  [_Looking at himself in the glass_.]  Don’t think I quite
        like this buttonhole, Phipps.  Makes me look a little too old.  Makes me
        almost in the prime of life, eh, Phipps?
        
        PHIPPS.  I don’t observe any alteration in your lordship’s appearance.
        
        LORD GORING.  You don’t, Phipps?
        
        PHIPPS.  No, my lord.
        
        LORD GORING.  I am not quite sure.  For the future a more trivial
        buttonhole, Phipps, on Thursday evenings.
        
        PHIPPS.  I will speak to the florist, my lord.  She has had a loss in her
        family lately, which perhaps accounts for the lack of triviality your
        lordship complains of in the buttonhole.
